		Kanjify is an open-source kanji writing tool
		inspired by <a href="http://skritter.com">Skritter</a>. Kanjify

		<h4>Why does this exist?</h4>
		<p>
			Skritter is an awesome tool, but it's not free and relies on Flash.
			The goal of Kanjify is to bring
			similarly powerful tools to the open source world so that a
			variety of other applications can incorporate Chinese Character
			writing practice. Kanjify is written in Javascript so that it can
			work across as many platforms and devices as possible.
