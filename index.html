		<h4>Why does this exist?</h4>
		<p>
			Stroke order animations are cumbersome to create and difficult to
			customize. Kanjify offers a customizable SVG animation of
			kanji from <a href="https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg">kanjiVG</a>.
			Kanjify is written in Javascript so that it can
			work across as many platforms and devices as possible.
